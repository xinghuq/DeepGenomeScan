## Datasets

Simulation details are described in Capblancq et al. (2018), and the datasets can be accessed from the Dryad Digital Repository at: https://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.1s7v5. 

The datasets used for the analyses described in this manuscript were obtained from dbGap at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000145.v4.p2 through dbGap accession number phs000145.v4.p2.

Scripts used for the results reported in this paper are available through this github website.

Simulations:

Simulations_MLP.R : The scripts used for traing MLP model on 100 simulations.

Simulation_MLP_outliers: Scripts used for estimating the power of genome scan for three approaches, pcadapt, RDA, and DeepGenomeScan, as well as the figures for the simulations.

POPRES_DeepGenomeScan: Scripts used in analyses of POPRES data.
